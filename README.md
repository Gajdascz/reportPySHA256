# pySHA256

A personal implementation of the SHA256 algorithm in Python that creates a dynamic report for each input message that is hashed.

I created this purely for the fun of the challenge, to learn, and to continue expanding my knowledge of programming with mathematics.

As-is, this program should not be used for any real security application and needs additional testing, verification and polishing.

Core Material Used In Creating This Program:
        CSRC NIST Digest Length = 256 Example -  https://bit.ly/3AyNUW1
        CSRC NIST FIPS 18-4 - https://bit.ly/3TpA4xP
